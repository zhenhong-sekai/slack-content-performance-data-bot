# 🔄 Socket Mode Migration - Complete Implementation

## ✅ Migration Summary

OptiBot has been **successfully migrated** from webhook-based integration to **Slack Socket Mode**, providing enhanced capabilities for threaded conversations and improved reliability.

## 🚀 What Changed

### Architecture Changes
- ❌ **Removed**: Webhook endpoints (`/slack/events`, `/slack/commands`)
- ❌ **Removed**: Slash command support (`/query-data`)
- ✅ **Added**: Socket Mode WebSocket connection
- ✅ **Added**: Real-time event processing
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Full threaded conversation support

### Component Updates

#### New Socket Mode Client
- **File**: `src/services/slack_socket_client.py`
- **Features**:
  - WebSocket-based real-time connection
  - Full @ mention support in channels
  - Direct message processing
  - Thread reply detection and processing
  - Automatic query extraction from mentions

#### Socket Mode Worker
- **File**: `src/workers/socket_mode_worker.py`
- **Purpose**: Maintains WebSocket connection and processes Slack events
- **Replaces**: Previous webhook processing worker

#### Updated Configuration
- **Added**: `SLACK_APP_TOKEN` (required for Socket Mode)
- **Enhanced**: Token validation for app-level tokens
- **Updated**: Environment configuration and validation

### Docker Configuration Updates
- **Development**: `socket-mode-worker` service replaces `slack-processor`
- **Production**: Single Socket Mode connection (no need for multiple replicas)
- **Resources**: Optimized resource allocation for WebSocket connections

## 🎯 New User Experience

### @ Mentions (Primary Interface)
```bash
# In any channel where OptiBot is added
@OptiBot show me last week's performance metrics
@OptiBot what were the top campaigns yesterday?
@OptiBot get server uptime stats for the past month
```

### Direct Messages
```bash
# Direct message to OptiBot
show me customer engagement data for this quarter
what's our conversion rate by channel?
pull yesterday's system performance metrics
```

### Threaded Conversations ✨ NEW!
```bash
User: @OptiBot show me Q4 revenue data
OptiBot: [Uploads CSV] Here's your Q4 revenue data with 1,234 records...

User: (reply in thread) Can you break that down by product line?
OptiBot: [Uploads CSV] Here's the breakdown by product line...

User: (reply in thread) What about compared to Q3?
OptiBot: [Uploads CSV] Here's the Q3 vs Q4 comparison...
```

### Event Handling Flow
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Slack Platform] -->|WebSocket| B[Socket Mode Worker]
    B --> C{Event Type}
    C -->|app_mention| D[Handle @ Mention]
    C -->|message.im| E[Handle DM]
    C -->|message.channels| F[Handle Thread Reply]
    D --> G[Queue Agent Task]
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H[Agent Processor]
    H --> I[Send Results to Thread]
```

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Thread Detection
```python
async def _handle_thread_reply(self, event: Dict[str, Any], say):
    """Handle replies in threads where bot was mentioned."""
    thread_ts = event.get("thread_ts")
    if thread_ts:
        # Process as threaded conversation
        await self._queue_query(..., thread_ts=thread_ts)
```

#### 2. Mention Extraction
```python
def _extract_query_from_mention(self, text: str) -> str:
    """Extract query from @ mention, removing bot reference."""
    mention_pattern = r"<@[A-Z0-9]+>"
    clean_text = re.sub(mention_pattern, "", text).strip()
    return clean_text
```

#### 3. Context Preservation
- Thread timestamps (`thread_ts`) maintained across all responses
- Conversation context preserved in threaded discussions
- Agent processor delivers results to correct thread

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for Socket Mode
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret-here  
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token-here  # NEW! Required for Socket Mode
```

### 2. Slack App Configuration
Use the provided **`slack-app-manifest.json`** for automatic setup:
- ✅ Socket Mode enabled
- ✅ Required OAuth scopes configured
- ✅ Event subscriptions set up
- ✅ Bot user configured

### 3. Deployment
```bash
# Development
./scripts/start-dev.sh

# Production
./scripts/deploy-prod.sh
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Debugging

### Service Health
```bash
# Check Socket Mode connection
docker-compose logs socket-mode-worker

# Check agent processing
docker-compose logs agent-processor

# Overall system health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Test Socket Mode connection
docker-compose exec socket-mode-worker python -c "
import asyncio
from src.services.slack_socket_client import get_slack_socket_service
async def test():
    service = await get_slack_socket_service()
    print(f'Bot User ID: {service.bot_user_id}')
asyncio.run(test())
"
```

@OptiBot show me last week's metrics

# Follow-up in thread (this is where Socket Mode shines!)
↳ can you break that down by channel?
↳ what about compared to the previous week?  
↳ show me the top 5 performing campaigns
↳ export the raw data for analysis
```
